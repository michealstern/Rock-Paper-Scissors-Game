# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This implementation includes HTML for the structure of the game, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality:

HTML: Defines a simple structure with buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors, and a result display area.
CSS: Styles the buttons and result display for a clean and responsive layout.
JavaScript: Implements the game logic. It adds click event listeners to each button. When a button is clicked,
it triggers the playRound function to determine the winner between the player's selection and a randomly 
generated computer selection (computerPlay). The result is displayed in the result <div>.
